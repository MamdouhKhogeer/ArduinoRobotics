  # Final Project

## Description
the robot will be a pencil/pen holder that can draw based on motions or a script. The motion will be translated from
phone's touch screen to the robot. 

### Hardware
#### for hardware there could be several options:
  1. it could perform like claw arm, but there would be holder instead of claw. Basically, four motors to control the arm that
    is held on a board.
  2. a wireframe box where a stick is hangged on the top that holds the pen.

#### Hardware:
  1. either stepper motor, servo motor, or both of them together... not sure how many, but it's either 3 or 4.
  2.
