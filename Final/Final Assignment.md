# Final Project

## Project Discription
  The robot is a two axis printer that prints with a pen. the robot was extracted from an HP inkjet printer with a scanner.
  I took the printer apart to look for usefull parts inside of it. Then i found out that i could use the printer structure, motor mechanism, 
  and wires to make the robot.
  
## Easrly explorations & Research
  * At first, i wanted to make the two axis printer looks like an arm. I found out that the mechanism of this would be diffuclt to build as the class and the teacher agreed to that.

  * Michelle Herrera (a classmate) shared with me some links of other simpler drawing robots. From these links i found other intriguing robots. For examples, using two DVD writers to build a small CNC machine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VFOU-WUQIY&t=5s , a cardbaord 3 axis machine http://www.instructables.com/id/High-Precision-Cardboard-CNC-Drawing-Machine/, and a two axis machine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnZI0ovzb4c
  
  * Most of these machines use stepper motors, a CNC shield, and a ready to use code. So it seemed to me if i addapted any of them, i would be bound by its boundries.
  * Later, I found the printer that i'm using its parts for the robot.
  
## Hardware
  ### Most of the mechanical parts are from the printer which inclueds:
  * two DC motors for X,Y axises.
  * Gears.
  * structure
  ### Other parts
  * Arduino
  * Breadbaord
  * Two VL53L0X measuring Sensors.
  * AdaFruit Motor Shield
