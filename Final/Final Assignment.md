# Final Project

## Project Discription
  The robot is a two axis printer that prints with a pen. the robot was extracted from an HP inkjet printer with a scanner.
  I took the printer apart to look for usefull parts inside of it. Then i found out that i could use the printer structure, motor mechanism, 
  and wires to make the robot.
  
## Easrly explorations & Research
  *At first, i wanted to make the two axis printer looks like an arm, but i found out that the mechanism of this would be diffuclt to build.
